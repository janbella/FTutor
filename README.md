# FTutor1D
A free tool for visualization of 1D Fourier Transform.

This application was developed as a student's project at [Centre for Biomedical Image Analysis (CBIA)](http://www.cbia.fi.muni.cz) at [Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk university in Brno](http://www.fi.muni.cz). [Read more](http://www.cbia.fi.muni.cz/projects/ftutor1d.html).


**New**: you can download prepared [binary for windows](https://github.com/janbella/FTutor1D/raw/master/bin/FT1D_win32_x86.zip).

## About

The application serves as an educational tool for Fourier transform. Users can quickly become familiar with the transform by investigating the simple signals, modifying the signal in the frequency domain and comparing the changes back in the time domain. An advanced visualisation of Fourier basis functions is also a great feature of this application. 

The application is designed to be precise, real-time, multiplatform and extensible. The tradeof for extensibility is using external files, which has to be available at the correct paths to make the application work correctly. However, without the need of recompiling the application, one can add new language versions or load own signals. Signals can be also created by the user in the application and saved later.

Manipulation with single coefficients is not the only way of modifying the signal. The application can help users understand ideal, Gaussian and Butterworth filters and their applications on the frequency domain signal. Both original and modified signals are visible to the user.
