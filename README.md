# FTutor1D
A free tool for visualization of 1D Fourier transform

**New**: you can download prepared [binary for windows](https://github.com/janbella/FTutor1D/blob/master/bin/FT1D_win32_x86.zip).

This build is a preview meant for testing purposes, bugs and other issues might appear.



## Notice

Directory resources (and eventually translation) must be located in the same folder as the executable. Otherwise, the application would not run correctly.
